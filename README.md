# Where are you?

Congratulations you have made it, you survived HTL Spengergasse! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You have arrived at your final destination, writing your diploma thesis.
Let's start simple, where are you in your current diploma thesis endeavour?

`What is this?`  
If you ask this question this place most likely isn't for you.

`I haven't started.`  
Great, all the doors are open head on over to [here](#from-the-beginning) to learn how to get started.

`I have already written my thesis.`  
Ok, now it depends, what you used.

If you used Word this document is of no help to you, you are in an unexplored parallel world.
You may need to color code blocks by yourself, I wish you the best of luck. 🍀
If you manage to survive please report back, your heroes journey will be worth retelling.

If you used AsciiDoctor, you are on the path of the wise and enlightened. 

`I have lot of PDFs and don't know what to do.`


## From the beginning

### Installation

Congratulations you either have the foresight to start early or are so late that you still get to choose. 
Start by installing AsciiDoctor, personally I recommend you do it the following way:

1. Install Chocolately.
2. Use the ``choco`` command to install ruby: ``gem install ruby``
3. Use ruby to install asciidoctor: ``gem install asciidoctor`` & ``gem install asciidoctor-pdf``
4. Also install pygments.rb (``gem install pygments.rb``) & pygments with python ``pip install pygments``

This will install everything on your system locally, maybe I missed something _you_ will find out.

In the ``./asciidoc`` directory I have provided a small template project, feel free to use it.
It's a good idea to upload this to a shared or private GitHub repository, so you can back up your work. 

### Standards

It's always good to have standards in life especially if you are working together with other humanoids. 
If you want, communicate with your team members on how to use _italic_, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and more in your text. 
Another good thing to agree on is how to use headings but overall these are not as noticeable as using different styles. 

### Writing

AsciiDoctor is generally well document and if you don't find something right away than my advice is to forget about it. 
Find another easier way around it, this will help with consistency but more importantly nobody will care nor notice. 
This is something you will learn very quickly too, there is no order in writing a diploma thesis while you are provided a template you can still do a lot.
Just look at all these people leaving 2m space between their lines, if they get away with it, your not aligned image won't budge any eyebrows.

I can't give much advice on *how* to write your thesis. 
This is for you to find out, it depends on your situation if you want to address the reader directly or not.
How many sources you should consult or the ratio between images, codeblocks and raw text.
Just do what feels right and consult your supervisor.
This is the majority of the work.
